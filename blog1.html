          <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Mike, and welcome to my blog :)</p>

          <p>I'm not sure yet exactly what this platform is going to be yet. My initial plan when I decided to start this was to write tutorials and help explain complicated Software Engineering topics in a simpler way, that could be accessible to all audiences.</p>

          <p>For the most part, this blog will be mostly that, and I'll refer to those posts as "Tech Guides". However, as much as I love computer science, I have other interests as well.</p>

          <p>There will probably be some none CS related posts. Music, video games, basketball, and consumer electronics are just a handful of my interests outside of the programming spectrum. Beyond that, I love to think and ponder
          about various topics of life, so a few of these might just be writing my thoughts out. </p>

          <p>This blog doesn't really have an identity yet, and that's ok. Nothing really does at inception. This is good though, as it gives me a chance to be creative and to experiment without the pressures of hitting specific goals.</p>

          <p>The only constraint I'm going to put on myself is that I'll have a post about <i> something </i> out every Friday here going forward. This way you all know when to look for new content and I have a way of holding myself accountable.</p>

          <p>Lastly, I'm going to post all of these on Medium as well, as I know many of you may prefer to read your blogs over there.</p>

          <p>I'll be back next Friday with the first actual post.</p>

          <p>Have a nice weekend,</p>
