            Hello! My name is Michael Hendrick. I'm a Software Engineer at
            <u><a href="https://www.meta.com">Meta</a></u
            >, where I also interned in the Summer of 2019 (then Facebook).
            <br /><br />
            I am based out of the company's Washington D.C. office, where I work
            on an Integrity team that works to keep users safe from potential
            real world threats.
            <br /><br />
            I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from the
            <u
              ><a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu"
                >Georgia Institute of Technology</a
              ></u
            >
            , which I obtained via their online campus while working at Meta.
            <br /><br />
            While in undergrad at
            <u><a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/">Boston University</a></u
            >, I was a Software Engineering Intern at
            <u><a href="https://www.akamai.com"> Akamai Technologies</a></u
            >, working on a incident management system. Even futher back, I was
            a software quality assurance intern at
            <u><a href="https://www.mindera.com">Mindera Inc</a></u
            >, working on automated testing for web apps. <br /><br />Across
            these positions, I've been blessed to be surrounded by very talented
            developers, who have encouraged me to develop some pretty nifty
            projects over the years. One of which was an web application to help
            fellow students find study partners. You can find an article about
            it
            <u

                href="https://www.bu.edu/spark/2019/11/06/student-spotlight-michael-hendrick/"
                >here</a
              ></u
            >. <br /><br />
            During my undergraduate years, I was lucky enough to have the
            opportunity to be a Senior undergraduate course assistant for the BU
            computer Science department, where every semester I got a chance to
            share my passion for CS with new students. I expanded my teaching by
            serving as the lead Teaching Assitance in
            <u><a href="http://www.bu.edu/spark/">BU's Spark!</a></u> program. I
            was also the Technical Lead for a chapter of
            <u><a href="https://hack4impact.org/"> Hack4Impact</a></u
            >, an oncampus organization that creates applications for
            non-profits in our communities. Additionally, I served a year as the
            Head of Technology for
            <u><a href="https://bostonhacks.org/">BostonHacks</a></u
            >, one of the Northeast's premier hackathons. <br /><br />
            I also wrote two academic papers in my final semester of undergrad,
            one of which was accepted and featured at
            <u><a href="https://2020.debs.org/">DEBS 2020</a></u
            >. More information can be found on my
            <u><a href="./research.html">research</a></u> page.
